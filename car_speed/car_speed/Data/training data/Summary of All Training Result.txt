Mxvy: Map x video y

Roundx: Train the model "separately" 5 times to estimate the average mse of the model output from the algorithm. We didn't retrain the model, 5 rounds just mean we create a new model and train it with the same feature set for each round and then compare their difference

Mx Overall: Combine all the feature sets in Map x and train it to test how our model fit the whole map. 

MSE: Mean square error, the average squared difference between the estimate values and the actual value.
